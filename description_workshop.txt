- This mod is still in development so it doesn't have a lot of content but there is more planned for the future. 

- Depths Of Darkness is a content mod focused on a dark thematic that brings a variety of new items, weapons, enemies and more to come in the future.
My objective with this mod is to not change much of the original terraria experience and simply add to it.

- Current version: 0.1.6.1
  * Check the change notes for details of updates

- Features:
  * 100+ new items including:
   * 9 new accessories
   * 3 new armor sets (9 pieces of armor)
   * 7 new crafting materials
   * 60 new weapons
  * 15 new enemies (13 of which with their own banner)
  * recipes for a few vanilla items 
  * and more to come!
 
(tip: Once you defeat the boss on your evil biome new enemies will start appearing.)

(tip2: I recommend the use of a mod called Recipe Browser to avoid missing any content as there's no wiki)
