# Depths Of Darkness

- [Steam Workshop](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3202321582).

- Depths Of Darkness is a content mod focused on a dark thematic that brings a variety of new items, weapons, enemies and more to come in the future.
My objective with this mod is to not change much of the original terraria experience and simply add to it. The mod must be installed using [tModLoader](https://github.com/tModLoader/tModLoader).

## Relevant Information

1) This mod was developed by one person with no previous experience on programming so it's not the most optmized code.
2) You are free to utilize the code with credit. However the same does not apply to art, music or anything of the kind.
3) I don't have that much time to develop the mod anymore but if you wish to help in the mod development please feel free to contact me on discord: .forthwind

## Credits and Thanks

- Credits to the Calamity Mod for the monster banner code that made possible adding banners to any NPCs I added or ever wish to add.
